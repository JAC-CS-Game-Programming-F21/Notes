# Let's Make Some Games!

Welcome to Game Programming! I'm really excited to teach and learn the process of developing games with you. Even though we'll "only" be making 2D games in this course, I think you'll be surprised at how complex these (seemingly simple) games are to develop. Hopefully, you'll gain an appreciation of how developers back in the day were able to accomplish so much with limited (for their time) hardware.
